# Tree segmentation from Satellite images.

To perform a segmentation task, first we need a dataset with corresponding mask images.
To create mask images from the real images, I have attached some scripts that in under "scripts" folder.
After creating the mask and real image pair, we can continue with the models.

We have many options but in ecosystem mostly use two models for segmentation tasks:

1- uNet

2- Mask RCNN
